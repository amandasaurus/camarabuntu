  License: GPLv2 with the following additional requirement:
You may (with a few exceptions) not modify the location of the

This says:
------------------------------------------
 | WARNING you are only allowed to change this filename if you also
 | change the documentation and add a statement that makes clear
 | where the official location of the file is why you did choose a
 | nonstandard location and that the nonstandard location only refers
 | to unofficial cdrecord versions.
 |
 | I was forced to add this because some people change cdrecord without
 | rational reason and then publish the result. As those people
 | don't contribute work and don't give support, they are causing extra
 | work for me and this way slow down the cdrecord development.
