This is the Debian Linux prepackaged version of the mkdosfs the creator
for MS-DOS filesystems either on harddisks or on floppies.

This package was put together by Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>,
from sources obtained from:
 sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/dosfs/mkdosfs-ygg-0.3b.lsm
 sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/dosfs/mkdosfs-ygg-0.3b.tar.gz
 sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/dosfs/dosfsck.1.tar.z

Mkdosfs is copyrighted by Dave Hudson <dave@humbug.demon.co.uk>, and was
later maintained and improved by H. Peter Anvin <hpa@yggdrasil.com>.
Dave has put the whole package under the GPL.

Dosfsck is copyrighted by Werner Almesberger <werner.almesberger@lrc.di.epfl.ch>
and Roman Hodek. We both together put the package under the GPL.

The FAT32, LFN, and Atari format additions are copyrighted by Roman
Hodek <Roman.Hodek@informatik.uni-erlangen.de> and are under the GPL, too.

Both tools (mkdosfs and dosfsck) have been unmaintained since some
time, so I also took them over as upstream maintainer. The merged
package is named dosfstools-2.0, and its home site is now
  ftp.uni-erlangen.de:/pub/Linux/LOCAL/dosfstools
