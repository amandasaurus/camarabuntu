  Try these boot commands if DBAN hangs at the black boot screen:

    nofloppy  Start without loading the floppy driver. This allows DBAN to
              run on most problematic laptop computers.

    nosilent  Print kernel messages. Watch for errors and report the last few
              lines that are printed if you make a support request.
 
    noverify  Run a write-only wipe. Try this boot command if you know that
              this computer has a bad disk in it.

  Read http://www.dban.org/faq/ before making a support request, and attach the
  DBAN log file (dban0000.tgz) if DBAN fails in any way. DBAN cannot write log
  files to USB floppy drives.
