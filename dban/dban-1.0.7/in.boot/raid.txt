  DBAN is compatible with many hardware RAID implementations, but it is
  untested and unsupported.

  Disassemble all volumes and export all disks in JBOD mode prior to running
  DBAN on a computer with a RAID controller. Spare disks and failed disks are
  not wiped if they are part of a volume.

  Except 3Ware equipment, all current RAID solutions for PATA and SATA disks
  are faux and are actually implemented by the operating system with drivers.
  This includes all on-board motherboard controllers. DBAN does not have
  "fakeraid" drivers and it recognizes IDE-RAID devices as regular IDE
  controllers.
