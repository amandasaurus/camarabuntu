 Darik's Boot and Nuke: About
 ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

 Darik's Boot and Nuke ("DBAN") is a self-contained boot floppy that securely
 wipes the hard disks of most computers. DBAN will automatically and completely
 delete the contents of any hard disk that it can detect, which makes it an
 appropriate utility for bulk or emergency data destruction.

 This software wipes IDE and SCSI hard disks only.  It does not recognize USB
 devices, IEEE 1394 (Firewire) devices, or any kind of removable media.  All
 storage devices that this software detects will be wiped. A 32-bit or 64-bit
 x86 class CPU with 8 megabytes of memory is required for proper operation.

 All DBAN components are subject to copyright.  Please see the 'licenses'
 folder within the DBAN distribution package for additional information.

 Additional documentation will be available at http://www.dban.org/
