dban-1.0.7 contains:

  * SysLinux 2.13
  * Linux 2.4.33
  * LZMA 4.32
  * uClibc 0.9.20
  * Busybox 0.60.5
  * Ncurses 5.3
  * WinImage 8.0.8000

 dban-1.0.7 was compiled with Debian gcc-3.3 1:3.3.5-13

 This release is compressed with LZMA, which provides much more free space on
 the floppy disk.  LSI MPT and I2O drivers were added.

 Thanks go to Igor Sobrado for reporting the "5220.22-M" typo.
 
 Thanks go to Dorina Lanza for reporting a block adjustment error.


dban-1.0.6 contains:

  * SysLinux 2.13
  * Linux 2.4.31
  * uClibc 0.9.20
  * Busybox 0.60.5
  * Ncurses 5.3
  * WinImage 7

 dban-1.0.6 was compiled with Debian gcc-3.3 1:3.3.5-12

 Performance on computers with the Intel i915/ICH6 chipset has improved.

 Rawrite has been replaced with the WinImage SFX wrapper.  You can unzip
 the EXE file on Linux to obtain the IMG file.  Ignore the offset warnings.

 This release fixes the erratum where time stamps in the dwipe.txt log were
 behind the dban.txt log by one month.  The problem was caused by incorrect
 use of tm_mon in fsprintf and is unrelated to the hardware clock.  Thanks
 go to Pirie Hart <pirie@u.washington.edu> for providing an accurate bug
 report.

 This release handles more disks that have odd sector counts or unusual
 sector sizes. Thanks go to Thomas Radke <radket@nv.doe.gov> for validating
 the change.

 Thanks go to Zube for providing more weird hardware samples.

  * Linux 2.4.30
  * uClibc 0.9.20
  * Busybox 0.60.5
  * Ncurses 5.3

  * SysLinux 2.08
  * Linux 2.4.24, Debian version 1
  * uClibc 0.9.20
  * Busybox 0.60.5
  * Ncurses 5.3

 dban-1.0.3 was compiled with Debian gcc-3.3 1:3.3.3-0pre3.

 The "scanning for seed files" startup message was disabled because it
 confused too many users, but the rc script still checks for seed files.

 The description of the OPS-II wipe was changed from "Low" to "Medium",
 but the implementation is unchanged.

 The DoD short method is comprised of passes 1,2,7 from the DoD standard
 method.  The DoD standard method in dwipe uses an algorithm that was adapted
 from the Heidi Eraser product.

 The start key was changed to F10 so that DBAN will run on computers with
 keyboards that do not have the F11 and F12 keys.  F12 will still start the
 wipe, but using F12 is now deprecated.
 

dban-1.0.2 contains:

  * SysLinux 2.06
  * Linux 2.4.22, Debian version 1
  * uClibc 0.9.20
  * Busybox 0.60.5
  * Ncurses 5.3

 dban-1.0.0 was compiled with Debian gcc-3.3 1:3.3.1-0pre0.

 GCC 3.2.3 produces a kernel that is too large for a 1.44 megabyte floppy disk,
 and GCC 2.95.4 cannot compile the new mm/filemap.c without patching. Thus, GCC
 3.3.1 is the best compiler for this release.

 The purpose of this release is to add several new drivers to the kernel.  As a
 consequence, there is only 50 kilobytes free on the floppy disk.  As of this
 writing, there are no known problems with the dban-1.0.1 release.  If you need
 extra space on the floppy disk for seed files or log files, then continue to
 use the dban-1.0.1 release.
