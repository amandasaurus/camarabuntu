      2.7  Certified Documents.

      2.7.1  Certified Documents and CD Services. The Software may allow you to validate Certified Documents. A "Certified Document" or “CD” is a PDF file that has been digitally signed using (a) a certificate and (b) a “private” encryption key that corresponds to the “public” key in the certificate. Validation of a CD requires CD Services from the CD Service Provider that issued the certificate. “CD Service Provider” is an independent third party service vendor listed at http://www.adobe.com/security/partners_cds.html. “CD Services” are services provided by CD Service Providers, including without limitation (i) certificates issued by such CD Service Provider for use with the Software's CD feature set, (ii) services related to issuance of certificates, and (iii) other services related to certificates, including without limitation verification services.

      2.7.2  CD Service Providers. Although the Software may provide validation features, Adobe does not supply the necessary CD Services required to use these features. Purchasing, availability and responsibility for the CD Services are between you and the CD Service Provider. Before you rely upon any CD, any digital signature applied thereto, and/or any related CD Services, you must first review and agree to the applicable Issuer Statement and this Agreement. “Issuer Statement” means the terms and conditions under which each CD Service Provider offers CD Services (see the links on http://www.adobe.com/security/partners_cds.html), including for example any subscriber agreements, relying party agreements, certificate policies and practice statements, and Section 2.7 of this Agreement. By validating a CD using CD Services, you acknowledge and agree that (a) the certificate used to digitally sign a CD may be revoked at the time of verification, making the digital signature on the CD appear valid when in fact it is not, (b) the security or integrity of a CD may be compromised due to an act or omission by the signer of the CD, the applicable CD Service Provider, or any other third party and (c) you must read, understand, and be bound by the applicable Issuer Statement.

      2.7.3  Warranty Disclaimer. CD Service Providers offer CD Services solely in accordance with the applicable Issuer Statement. ACCESS TO THE CD SERVICES THROUGH THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE IS MADE AVAILABLE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS ONLY AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OR INDEMNITY OF ANY KIND (EXCEPT AS SUPPLIED BY A CD SERVICES PROVIDER IN ITS ISSUER STATEMENT). ADOBE AND EACH CD SERVICE PROVIDER (EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN ITS ISSUER STATEMENT) MAKE NO WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, INDEMNITIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR TERMS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHETHER BY STATUTE, COMMON LAW, CUSTOM, USAGE OR OTHERWISE AS TO ANY OTHER MATTERS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, TITLE, INTEGRATION, ACCURACY, SECURITY, AVAILABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE CD SERVICES.

      2.7.4  Indemnity. You agree to hold Adobe and any applicable CD Service Provider (except as expressly provided in its Issuer Statement) harmless from any and all liabilities, losses, actions, damages, or claims (including all reasonable expenses, costs, and attorneys fees) arising out of or relating to any use of, or reliance on, any CD Service, including, without limitation (a) reliance on an expired or revoked certificate, (b) improper verification of a certificate, (c) use of a certificate other than as permitted by any applicable Issuer Statement, this Agreement or applicable law; (d) failure to exercise reasonable judgment under the circumstances in relying on the CD Services or (e) failure to perform any of the obligations as required in an applicable Issuer Statement.

      2.7.5  Limit of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ADOBE OR ANY CD SERVICE PROVIDER (EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ITS ISSUER STATEMENT) BE LIABLE TO YOU, OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, REVENUE OR PROFIT, LOST OR DAMAGED DATA, OR OTHER COMMERCIAL OR ECONOMIC LOSS OR FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, STATUTORY, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RELATED TO YOUR USE OR RELIANCE UPON CD SERVICES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE. THIS LIMITATION SHALL APPLY EVEN IN THE EVENT OF A FUNDAMENTAL OR MATERIAL BREACH OR A BREACH OF THE FUNDAMENTAL OR MATERIALTERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

      2.7.6  Third Party Beneficiaries. You agree that any CD Service Provider you utilize shall be a third party beneficiary with respect to this Section 2.7 of this Agreement, and that such CD Service Provider shall have the right to enforce such provisions in its own name as if the CD Service Provider were Adobe.

As used in this Section, "limited warranty period" means one (1) year if you are a business user and two (2) years if you are not a business user.

THIS LIMITED WARRANTY DOES NOT APPLY TO SOFTWARE PROVIDED TO YOU FREE OF CHARGE, FOR EXAMPLE, UPDATES, PRE-RELEASE, TRYOUT, PRODUCT SAMPLER, NOT FOR RESALE (NFR) COPIES OF SOFTWARE, OR SOFTWARE THAT HAS BEEN ALTERED BY YOU, TO THE EXTENT SUCH ALTERATIONS CAUSED A DEFECT. To make a warranty claim, during the limited warranty period you must return, at our expense, the Software and proof of purchase to the location where you obtained it. If the functionalities of the Software vary substantially from the agreed upon functionalities, Adobe is entitled -- by way of re-performance and at its own discretion -- to repair or replace the Software. If this fails, you are entitled to a reduction of the purchase price (reduction) or to cancel the purchase agreement (rescission). For further warranty information, please contact Adobe's Customer Support Department

      14.2  Limitation of Liability for Users Residing in Germany and Austria.

      14.2.1  If you obtained the Software in Germany or Austria, and you usually reside in such country, then Section 8 does not apply, Instead, subject to the provisions in Section 14.2.2, Adobe's statutory liability for damages shall be limited as follows: (i) Adobe shall be liable only up to the amount of damages as typically foreseeable at the time of entering into the purchase agreement in respect of damages caused by a slightly negligent breach of a material contractual obligation and (ii) Adobe shall not be liable for damages caused by a slightly negligent breach of a non-material contractual obligation.

      14.2.2  The aforesaid limitation of liability shall not apply to any mandatory statutory liability, in particular, to liability under the German Product Liability Act, liability for assuming a specific guarantee or liability for culpably caused personal injuries.

      14.2.3  You are required to take all reasonable measures to avoid and reduce damages, in particular to make back-up copies of the Software and your computer data subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

      14.3  Pre-release Product Additional Terms. If the product you have received with this license is pre-commercial release or beta Software ("Pre-release Software"), then the following Section applies. To the extent that any provision in this Section is in conflict with any other term or condition in this Agreement, this Section shall supercede such other term(s) and condition(s) with respect to the Pre-release Software, but only to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict. You acknowledge that the Software is a pre-release version, does not represent final product from Adobe, and may contain bugs, errors and other problems that could cause system or other failures and data loss. Consequently, the Pre-release Software is provided to you "AS-IS", and Adobe disclaims any warranty or liability obligations to you of any kind. WHERE LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED FOR PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE, BUT IT MAY BE LIMITED, ADOBE'S LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SUM OF FIFTY DOLLARS (U.S. $50) IN TOTAL.

During the term of this Agreement, if requested by Adobe, you will provide feedback to Adobe regarding testing and use of the Pre-release Software, including error or bug reports. If you have been provided the Pre-release Software pursuant to a separate written agreement, such as the Adobe Systems Incorporated Serial Agreement for Unreleased Products, your use of the Software is also governed by such agreement. You agree that you may not and certify that you will not sublicense, lease, loan, rent, assign or transfer the Pre-release Software.
