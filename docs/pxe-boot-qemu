See network-qemu-instances-togeter first for how to connect several instances
together

Although there's a "-boot n" option in qemu > 0.9 which claims to do this, I've
never found it to work. It always just booted off the hard drive.

Instead boot off pxe-boot-qemu-cd.iso. eg:

qemu -hda foo.img -cdrom pxe-boot-cd.iso -boot d -net nic -net socket,connect=:8080

Obviously it's pointless to PXE boot if you don't have a network set up first
